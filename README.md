# JWT Role-Based Authentication API

## Overview
This project implements **JWT-based authentication with role-based access control (RBAC)** in a NestJS application. It allows users to log in using a username and password, receive a JWT token, and access different endpoints based on their assigned roles.

## Features
- User authentication using **JWT (JSON Web Token)**
- Role-based access control with custom **Guards**
- Secure endpoints that restrict access based on user roles
- Implements **Passport.js** for authentication strategies
- **Local Strategy** for username-password authentication
- **JWT Strategy** for token verification

## Technologies Used
- **NestJS** (A progressive Node.js framework)
- **Passport.js** (Authentication middleware)
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** (For secure authentication)

## Project Setup
### Clone the repository
```sh
git clone <repo_url>
cd my-sixth-app
```

The server will start at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Code Structure & Explanation

### 1. **User Authentication & JWT Token Generation**
- `local.strategy.ts`: Implements username-password authentication.
- `jwt.strategy.ts`: Extracts and validates JWT from the request.
- `auth.service.ts`: Handles JWT token generation.

**Login Flow:**
1. User sends a `POST /app/login` request with `username` and `password`.
2. `LocalStrategy` validates the user.
3. If valid, `AuthService` generates a JWT token.
4. User receives the JWT token to use for protected endpoints.

### 2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- `constants.ts`: Defines available roles (`IOS_DEVELOPER`, `ANDROID_DEVELOPER`, `GAME_DEVELOPER`).
- `role.guard.ts`: Custom **Guard** that checks the user's role before allowing access to endpoints.

**Access Control Flow:**
1. A user makes a request to a protected endpoint.
2. `JwtStrategy` verifies the JWT token.
3. `RoleGuard` checks if the user has the correct role.
4. If authorized, access is granted; otherwise, an error is returned.

### 3. **User Management**
- `user.service.ts`: Contains a hardcoded list of users with different roles.
- `user.entity.ts`: Defines the **User** model.

## API Endpoints

### 1. **User Login (Generate JWT Token)**
#### Request:
```sh
POST /app/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "User1",
  "password": "password1"
}
```
#### Response:
```json
{
  "access_token": "<JWT_TOKEN>"
}
```

### 2. **Access IOS Developer Data (Protected Route)**
#### Request:
```sh
GET /app/iosDeveloper
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
```
#### Response:
```json
{
  "message": "This is private data for IOS Developer",
  "user": { "username": "User1", "role": "Ios-Developer" }
}
```

### 3. **Access Android Developer Data (Protected Route)**
#### Request:
```sh
GET /app/androidDeveloper
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
```
#### Response:
```json
{
  "message": "This is private data for Android Developer",
  "user": { "username": "User2", "role": "Android-Developer" }
}
```

## Security Considerations
- The secret key (`the-secret-key`) should be stored securely (e.g., in environment variables).
- Passwords should be hashed before storing in a database.
- Token expiration should be set for better security.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Connect to a real database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Implement password hashing using `bcrypt`
- Add refresh token functionality
